# gulp-webpack-es6

## NPM to Start!

Start by running a blank task!
First, Command-line in the project folder of your choice:
```sh
$ npm install
```

Second,
```sh
$ gulp
```

That's it for now!


## Next, add Webpack and default webpack gulp commands

I added the gulp-util to help colorize console/command line output as well as a few other things I will explain over time.
I added webpack per my preferance and the webpack-dev-server for hot swapping code and simply running a server easily integrated with webpack.
